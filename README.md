# Experimenting with Python + OpenAI
---
I started learning Python and figured the best way to learn was by learning how to use OpenAI's API at the same time

- I used a virtual environment, which is not included is this repo
- I also used a .env file for my API key environment variable, also not include in the repo
- This code sample is taken from the Quick start documentation on platform.openai.com

~For my next adventure in Python I'll either continue working with OpenAI, or dive into the pygame library and start my first game project~
- Added simple quickstart tutorial from pygame documentation

---
- openai-test.py requires openai pip package and python-dotenv pip package
- pygame-tut.py requires pygame pip package
